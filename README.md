# SIMCLR Implementation - kongara_Task_2

This repository contains the implementation of Task 2 using the SIMCLR (Contrastive Learning) approach.

## Implementation Logic

### Step 1: Reading CSV File
The initial step involves reading the CSV file named "data.csv". This file likely contains column ACC X data for the task.

### Step 2: Converting ACC X to Spectrograms
In this step, the values from the "ACC X" column of the CSV file are processed to create spectrograms. Spectrograms are a way to represent the frequency content of a signal over time.

### Step 3: Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is applied to the spectrograms to enhance the diversity of the training data. As a starting point, random blurring is employed to simulate various real-world scenarios.

### Step 4: Using Pre-trained Network for Encoding
This step, which will be added later, involves utilizing a pre-trained neural network for encoding the augmented spectrogram data. This encoding extracts meaningful features from the data.

### Step 5: Custom Projection-Head
Following the encoding step, a custom projection head will be employed. A projection head is used to further transform the encoded features into a space where contrastive loss can be applied effectively.

### Step 6: Contrastive Loss and Network Update
The contrastive loss is employed to update the network's weights. This loss function encourages similar representations for augmented views of the same data while pushing different data points apart. Through optimization, the network learns meaningful representations.

## To-Do (Future Steps)

### Step 4: Using Pre-trained Network for Encoding
Incorporate a pre-trained network, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a pretrained backbone like ResNet, to perform the encoding of augmented spectrogram data.

### Step 5: Custom Projection-Head
Develop a custom projection head architecture that takes encoded features and projects them into a suitable space for applying contrastive loss.

### Step 6: Contrastive Loss and Network Update
Implement the contrastive loss function, which quantifies the similarity between positive pairs (augmented views of the same data) and maximizes this similarity while minimizing the similarity with negative pairs (views of different data). This step fine-tunes the network for meaningful feature extraction.
