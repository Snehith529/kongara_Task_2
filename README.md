# kongara_Task_2
SIMCLR_Implementation

Task-2 is implemented using following logic.


# Step 1: The CSV files named "data.csv" is read. 
# Step 2: The column "ACC X" values are converted into spectograms
# Step 3: For Augmentation - started with random blur;

# Processes that will be added later are:

# Step 4: Use a pre-trained network for encoding
# Step 5: Use a custom Projection-head
# Step 6: Use contrastive loss to update the network and get the output
